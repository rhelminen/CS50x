# Problem Set 8 - Homepage

https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/psets/8/homepage/

This is a small homepage project that didn't really have any significant distribution code and only a few concrete requirements, so basically everything is fully made by me.

As this was my first time working with JavaScript, I wanted to focus on that. I came up with a few ideas that I could implement on the site, and then started figuring out how to make them happen. The biggest challenge was creating the typewriter effect, which I built from the ground up without any tutorials (except for the general idea for the blinking cursor). So maybe it could be implemented better, but at least it works!

I was already familiar with HTML and CSS, so the only other new thing for me was Bootstrap, which I also had never used before. I spent a lot of time familiarizing myself with it and tried to use it as much as possible, even though at times it felt like it would've been faster and easier to just write my own CSS. However, I can see how it would be quite useful once you get the hang of it and don't have to look at the documentation for every little thing.
