### Selected assignments from Harvard's CS50x online course

CS50x is Harvard's introductory course to computer sciences. It is available for free as an online course on [edx.org](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x).

I started taking the course in March 2021, right after finishing my bachelor's degree in music pedagogy. I had always been intrigued by programming, and with the coronavirus making sure I had no work as a musician, I finally felt like it was time to start learning how to code.

Here I will include some of the more interesting projects I've made during the course, which I'm now just one final project away from completing. I've thoroughly enjoyed it and would absolutely recommend CS50 to anyone wanting to get into coding! I feel it has given me a very strong foundation in programming, and I've certainly learned a lot more than from the few tutorials and small courses I had done before.

> If you find this and you're also doing the course, please do yourself a favor and don't look at other people's solutions before completing your own, as per CS50's guidelines of academic honesty. It will just hinder your progress, so if you really want to learn this stuff, copy-pasting full solutions to functions or entire assignments will get you nowhere. My purpose here is not at all to give solutions to the problems, but rather to share my work with potential future employers and students who have already completed the assignments and who just want to learn more by seeing how other people approached the problems.
